Based on the findings of the scrutiny, Notices were issued to the banks advising them to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance with the directions. After considering the replies received from the banks, oral submissions made in the personal hearings, where sought by the banks, and examination of additional submissions, if any, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with RBI directions were sustained and warranted imposition of monetary penalty on aforementioned seven banks, based on the extent of non-compliance in each bank.
